This also allows the deletion of dial plans,  ring groups, virtual fax, shared voicemail and conference bridges which cannot be recovered.\n### Authentication Scopes\n`voice-admin.v1.write` must be used when a token is requested from the Authentication API.\n","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["voice-admin","v1","extensions",":extensionId"],"host":["{{voice-admin-v1-extensions-extensionId-Url}}"],"query":[],"variable":[{"disabled":false,"type":"any","value":"<string>","key":"extensionId","description":"(Required) The extension's unique identifier."}]},"method":"DELETE","auth":null},"response":[{"id":"db74232d-70d2-4c21-b8b0-4536c382a5c7","name":"Extension deleted successfully","originalRequest":{"url":{"path":["voice-admin","v1","extensions",":extensionId"],"host":["{{voice-admin-v1-extensions-extensionId-Url}}"],"query":[],"variable":[{"type":"any","key":"extensionId"}]},"method":"DELETE","body":{}},"status":"No Content","code":204,"header":[{"key":"Content-Type","value":"text/plain"}],"body":"","cookie":[],"_postman_previewlanguage":"text"},{"id":"ccfbbf36-c576-4003-ba1e-2f2bd69044e1","name":"There was an error during authentication.

First, the API queues the request,\na return code of 202 means that the request was successfully queued - we typically process the request within milliseconds.\nNext, we process your request in two phases. First we initiate a call to the line identified by `from.lineId`. If this call is answered,\na call is then initiated to `dialString`. A common use of this API is to implement click-to-call functionality in applications by initiating\na call from a GoToConnect line to the targeted phone number.\n\nTo initiate a call on the line defined at `from.lineId`, make a request with the following body :\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"dialString\": \"(866) 768-5429\",\n    \"from\": {\n      \"lineId\": \"99be59bc-edfc-4c62-a73f-06087ec2fe00\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nWhen the call is answered on the line defined at `from.lineId`, a new call is initiated to `(866) 768-5429`.\n### Intercom\nWhen the  \"autoAnswer\" boolean is set to true, the call to the line identified by the lineId will be answered automatically when possible (the Intercom feature needs to be enabled on the line and the instructions to do so are available here: https://support.goto.com/connect/help/how-do-i-intercom-a-line-or-ring-group-gotoconnect-intercom-line-ring-group).  \nBy default, all newly created lines should have this feature enabled.  \n\nThis feature is intended to work with a single device connected and will not work properly in some situations. \nThe limitations include, but are not limited to, when a Ring Group or Call Queue is provided in the lineId. Another current limitation is when multiple devices are connected simultaneously, in which case multiple calls to the destination can be made at once. For the best user experience, this field should be used when a single device selected with the lineId exists. \n\nThe GoTo desktop application is considered a device that will be available to answer automatically the initiated call if possible. \n### Security\nThe authorization to initiate a call on a specific line is determined by the provided `ACCESS_TOKEN`. Lines from the authenticated user will be available for initiating a call. \nAlso, if the current user is a [super admin](https://support.goto.com/connect/help/how-do-i-give-a-user-user-group-super-admin-permissions-gotoconnect-give-super-admin-permissions)  of the organization, all lines of the organization will be available for initiating a call.  Note that if a super admin is associated to a device and a request is done on a line associated with this device, all devices associated to  this line will ring, not only the one of the super admin.\n\n### Authentication Scopes\n`calls.v2.initiate` must be used when a token is requested from the Authentication API.\n\n### Example Interaction with curl\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'https://api.goto.com/calls/v2/calls'          \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'                \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'                      \\\n  -d '{                                                    \\\n        \"dialString\": \"(866) 768-5429\",                    \\\n        \"from\": {                                          \\\n          \"lineId\": \"99be59bc-edfc-4c62-a73f-06087ec2fe00\" \\\n        }                                                  \\\n      }'\n```\n","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["calls","v2","calls"],"host":["{{calls-v2-calls-Url}}"],"query":[],"variable":[]},"header":[{"key":"Content-Type","value":"application/json"}],"method":"POST","auth":null,"body":{"mode":"raw","raw":"{\n    \"dialString\": \"<string>\",\n    \"from\": {\n        \"lineId\": \"<string>\"\n    },\n    \"autoAnswer\": false\n}"}},"response":[{"id":"069596c7-f2fb-4180-8b54-439eb63bc49b","name":"Your request was successfully queued for processing.","originalRequest":{"url":{"path":["calls","v2","calls"],"host":["{{calls-v2-calls-Url}}"],"query":[],"variable":[]},"method":"POST","body":{"mode":"raw","raw":"{\n    \"dialString\": \"(866) 768-5429\",\n    \"from\": {\n        \"lineId\": \"014ce388-da2c-d120-88f9-000100320002\"\n    },\n    \"autoAnswer\": false\n}"}},"status":"Accepted","code":202,"header":[{"key":"Content-Type","value":"text/plain"}],"body":"","cookie":[],"_postman_previewlanguage":"text"},{"id":"4c991bca-3cd1-424b-af85-bbb55aaa40d7","name":"The request has one/or more of these issues:\n  -

Fields cannot be removed by using a `null` value and they can be reset as explained below.\n\nSince the service behind this API doesn't know when the client posting to this endpoint becomes offline, the lifetime of the user presence must be handled through this endpoint. Specifically, when the service has previously received a `userStatus` of `IN_A_MEETING` and the status wasn't posted again for 60 seconds, it is assumed that the client has gone offline and that it is no longer in the meeting (and thus this status is reset). To keep your `IN_A_MEETING` status active, it must be sent continuously before it expires. A refresh period of about 50 seconds is recommended to protect yourself from unexpected latencies.\n\nAbsent fields do not reset values. As such, if `userAppearance`, `userDoNotDisturb`, `userDoNotDisturbExpiration`, `userStatus` or `userNote` are omitted, they are considered as if they were set to their respective previous values. In order to reset an appearance or meeting status, the fields must be explicitly set to `NONE`. To reset the `userNote` field, it must be set to `\"\"` (empty string). To reset the `userDoNotDisturbExpiration` field, reset the `userDoNotDisturb` field.\n\nThe presence service persists the `userAppearance`, `userDoNotDisturb`, `userStatus` and `userNote` fields and aggregates them into presence notification/responses even though the client which set them is offline.\n\nIn addition to the `/user-presence` endpoint, clients may also read their own user presence fields through the `/presence` endpoint or by subscribing to their own `userKey`. Only in these particular cases will the `userAppearance`, `userDoNotDisturb` and `userStatus` fields be available in the `Presence` object.\nWhen setting the `userDoNotDisturbExpiration` field with a valid ISO 8601 timestamp, the `userDoNotDisturb` field must also be set to `DO_NOT_DISTURB`. The `userDoNotDisturb` field will then keep that state until the timestamp is reached, at which point the `userDoNotDisturb` will expire and be reset to `NONE`. An expired `userDoNotDisturbExpiration` timestamp will be omitted from the response. A `userDoNotDisturbExpiration` timestamp in the past will be rejected.\nThe modified user's presence defaults to the owner of the authentication token and can otherwise be specified with the `userKey` parameter. Modifying another user's presence requires super admin permissions and modifications are limited to DoNotDisturb\n### Example #1\n```\ncurl -XPATCH 'https://api.goto.com/presence/v1/user-presence' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \"userStatus\": \"IN_A_MEETING\" }'\n```\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"userAppearance\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userDoNotDisturb\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userStatus\": \"IN_A_MEETING\",\n  \"userNote\": \"Live, laugh, love\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example #2\n```\ncurl -XPATCH 'https://api.goto.com/presence/v1/user-presence' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \\\n    \"userStatus\": \"NONE\", \\\n    \"userNote\": \"\" \\\n  }'\n```\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"userAppearance\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userDoNotDisturb\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userStatus\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userNote\": \"\"\n}\n```\n### Example #3\n```\ncurl -XPATCH 'https://api.goto.com/presence/v1/user-presence' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \\\n    \"userDoNotDisturb\": \"DO_NOT_DISTURB\", \\\n    \"userDoNotDisturbExpiration\": \"2029-11-30T01:17:23Z\" \\\n  }'\n```\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"userAppearance\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userDoNotDisturb\": \"DO_NOT_DISTURB\",\n  \"userDoNotDisturbExpiration\": \"2029-11-30T01:17:23Z\",\n  \"userStatus\": \"NONE\",\n  \"userNote\": \"\"\n}\n```\n### Example #4 (modifying another user's user presence)\n```\ncurl -XPATCH 'https://api.goto.com/presence/v1/user-presence?userKey={COLLEAGUE_USER_KEY}' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {SUPER_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN}' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{ \\\n    \"userDoNotDisturb\": \"DO_NOT_DISTURB\", \\\n    \"userDoNotDisturbExpiration\": \"2029-11-30T01:17:23Z\" \\\n  }'\n```\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"userDoNotDisturb\": \"DO_NOT_DISTURB\",\n  \"userDoNotDisturbExpiration\": \"2029-11-30T01:17:23Z\",\n}\n```\n### Authentication Scopes\n- `presence.v1.write` must be used when a token is requested from the Authentication API.\n","type":"text/plain"},"url":{"path":["presence","v1","user-presence"],"host":["{{presence-v1-user-presence-Url}}"],"query":[{"disabled":false,"key":"userKey","value":"<string>","description":"The user key of the user for which user-presence is to be modified.
